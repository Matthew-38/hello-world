# Hello-world
Just a set up repo for learning Git
My name is Matthew, I am from Ireland and I live in France. I have been learning coding since I was a teenager, but now I want to make it into a profession.
My favourite languages are Python and Javascript. I also like messing around with Linux systems, fixing things and working with the Linux Command Line (Bash). I appreciate HTML and CSS more and more and recently I created my CV in HTML and CSS, to have more control over how it looks and to customise it precisely as I want.
Other languages I know how to program in include: C, PHP, Java, and I have also looked at the basics of R, OCaml and a few others. 
I also know how to format and use database files like JSON, XML and CSV, as well as MySql (via PHP for example). 
On Git, I want to put some examples of code I have made. I am going to start with some old projects I made years ago.

Apart from programming, I am interested in languages (I'm a native English speaker, bilingual in French, and I speak some Russian, Spanish and Irish), some aspects of psychology, plants and the environment and keeping fit with running and cycling.

Although I am quite geeky with computers and stuff, a Linux user and I spend a lot of my time at the computer, I am not the clich√© of a geek, I would say, because I am also rather social.
